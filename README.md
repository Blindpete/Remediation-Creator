## Intro
Remediations play a pivotal role in effective client management, allowing organizations to proactively identify and resolve end-user issues. Additionally, they serve as a valuable tool for enforcing specific settings or configurations that may not be natively supported in Microsoft Intune. However, the process of crafting these scripts can often be intricate and time-consuming.

Imagine a solution where you can simply describe your desired configurations, and a tool generates the necessary scripts for you. If you find this idea appealing and are keen to explore such a solution, this blog is tailored to meet your exact needs.

## How does it work
In the end, the process is remarkably straightforward. The tool generates a detection script and, if desired, a remediation script based on your provided description. It then seamlessly uploads these scripts to your tenant, streamlining the entire process.

1. User authentication: The process starts with user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can upload scripts using the user token
2. User describes the purpose of the script: After authentication, the user provides a description of what the script is intended to do.
3. Building a prompt with instructions and the description to generate a detection script: This description, along with instructions, is used to build a prompt for GPT-3.5-turbo, which will then generate a detection script based on the input.
4. (Optional) Building an additional prompt with instructions, the detection script, and the description to generate a remediation script: Optionally, a further step involves building another prompt that includes the instructions, the detection script that was generated, and the description. This new prompt is for GPT-3.5-turbo to create a remediation script, presumably to address the issues the detection script identified.
5. Display at web page: The scripts or the output from GPT-3.5-turbo are then displayed on a web page.
6. User presses upload and script will add to tenant: Finally, the user can press an upload button, resulting in the script being added to the tenant.
