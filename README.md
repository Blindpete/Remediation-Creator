## Intro
As you know remediations are an essential part of the client management but also to become more proactive in detecting and solving issues of end users. It is also usefull to force settings or to set configurations which are not nativly supported in Intune. It is sometimes tricky and needs also some time to create the scripts. Wouldn't it be nice if you can only describe what you want have and a tool creates the scripts for you? If you are interested in such a solution than this blog address exacly your need!
